        I’m a creative and determined fiction and code writer. The passion that
        I bring to grammar I also apply to writing clean code. My background in
        customer service taught me how to take the numerous and varied requests
        made and translate them into a solution that both benefited the client
        as well as the company.

        The Missing Slate is a globally focused literary magazine and I am
        tasked with managing rights acquisition and navigating the legality of
        publishing stories from a multitude of countries and presses. I am
        responsible for a team of five to ten assistant editors who maintain our
        weekly publishing schedule as well as solicit and select pieces for
        quarterly releases. My experience as a webmaster for the University of
        Florida’s Center for European Studies has given me the experience of
        working with a small team within a larger organization to achieve both
        the goals of the department as well as the overall goals of the
        University of Florida.
