        I am a trained fiction editor, writer, bartender, server, jazz drummer,
        barista, passionate bread baker, and programmer. I've previously worked at
        the University of Florida, Brooklyn Digital Foundry, and Kentro (sadly now defunct),
        among others.
        
        Before that I worked for a decade or so as the Senior Fiction Editor for a 
        fantastically wonderful literary magazine, The Missing Slate, where I was lucky
        enough to interview Sebastien Doubinsky, publish translations by Margaret Jull Costa,
        Annie McDermott and quite a few others that I'm depressed to say I cannot recall, as
        well as work together with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie to publish a collection of writings
        by poets and authors from West Africa (if you can't tell I am most proud of that job,
        I do love programming though!).
