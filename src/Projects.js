        Please feel free to stalk me on LinkedIn, Github, Facebook (Juuuuust kidding 
        don't you know me?! I haven't touched that thing in years!), Instagram (Gotcha 
        again!), Live Journal (ok, this is real but I'm terrified to look at it), or 
        on the streets of Brooklyn. I prefer socially impactful (if this isn't a phrase 
        I don't want to hear it) work and while I love a good greenfield project most 
        of my time has been spent maintaining sadly neglected (but no less beautiful 
        for it!) codebases.
